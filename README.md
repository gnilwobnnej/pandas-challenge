Used the provided starter code as a starting point, filling out the information that was required. 

it already had this filled out. # Use the following to calculate the percentage of students who passed math (math scores greather than or equal to 70)

I'll pretend all the filled in math is correct. all looks okay. 

Finishing for the night - ending at Math scores by grade ---

4/12/23
starting back up at maths score by grade.

some pre written code is giving me error in the maths scores by grade and reading. just comment them out so I don't go crazy.
