Based on the data there are more students that are passing reading than there are passing maths.

The top 5 performing schools are all charter schools and the bottom 5 performing schools are those from the district. 

The amount of spending per student does not make the grades any better. Quite the opposite, the ones that spend less per student have better overall grades.

The smaller the school size the better the scores and over all charter schools have the most passing students over district.
